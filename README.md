Overall:
Keep track of enemy and friendly units with castles.
All units should by default avoid enemies units unless they are near a castle/church
	or a strike has been ordered.

Castles can always get castle talk from units, so units should use radios to communicate orders
	from castles to other units. Assuming units don't need to talk to each other.
Maybe castle could send out a long range radio message when it needs to broadcast to all units or just a single unit. This could be made more feasible by having all units stay within a max range from the castle they were constructed at.

Possibly Units could use radios to communicate with each other.
Possibly need multiturn communications to send more than 16bits.
